=================
This is an in-progress port of [chromaprint](https://github.com/acoustid/chromaprint)

> Chromaprint is an audio fingerprint library developed for the [AcoustID](https://acoustid.org/) project. It's designed to identify near-identical audio and the fingerprints it generates are as compact as possible to achieve that. It's not a general purpose audio fingerprinting solution. It trades precision and robustness for search performance. The target use cases are full audio file identification, duplicate audio file detection and long audio stream monitoring.
